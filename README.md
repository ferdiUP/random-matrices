Some work on random matrix theory and random graphs.

- wigner.py: shows the convergence of large random matrices eigenvalues distribution to Wigner semi-circle law : also an histogram of spacings between eigenvalues of 2x2 matrices (Wigner surmise)
- wishart.py: shows the convergence of dispersion matrices eigenvalues to the Marcenko-Pastur distribution.
